Testing git/github by adding repo in my local machine.
Use git init.

use git add .
git commit -m "message"
then git remote add origin HTTP repo link.

git remote -v to show connected repos
git push -u origin main/master/branchname to keep pushing to that repo/branch without writing onto that repo without writing origin main/etc.
