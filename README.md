Testing git/github by adding repo in my local machine.
Use "git init" for initializing the repo on local machine. Adds ".git" file in the folder.

use "git add ."
"git commit -m (message)"
then "git remote add origin (HTTP repo link)".

"git remote -v" to show connected repos
"git push -u origin main/master/branchname" to keep pushing to that repo/branch without writing onto that repo without writing origin main/etc.

"git branch" to check which branch you are on.

"git checkout -b  (branch name)" to create new branch.
